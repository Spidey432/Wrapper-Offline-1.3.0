# Wrapper: Offline
Wrapper: Offline is a GoAnimate Server Emulator carrying on the torch of [VisualPlugin's Wrapper project](https://github.com/GoAnimate-Wrapper) after it's shutdown in 2020. Unlike the original project, Offline can not be shut down by Vyond. Why? It's because of our twist on the Wrapper formula! Everything is hosted and programmed to function locally, no internet access required, barring the initial download (and TTS at this time). This project is important for archival purposes, as the ability to use this legacy editor and themes would be far trickier without it. Besides the main feature of Offline, we have also added other additional features and improvements compared to the original Wrapper project, and there will be more to come, as Offline will continue to get additional updates in the future.

These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project (and probably don't even know it exists) but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Wrapper: Offline.***
